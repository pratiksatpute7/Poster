 Areas of Expertise:  
 Use of synthetics and natural products in mitigating soil erosion and soil Dewatering and containment of dredged sediments and waste Use of recycle materials in civil infrastructures Women in science and engineering 
 Dr. Bhatia’s current research efforts focus on the testing, development, design, and innovative use of sustainable natural and polymeric materials for the protection of water quality. In the area of soil erosion, a significant issue that can negatively impact surface water quality, Dr. Bhatia has worked extensively to develop methods to reduce stream bank erosion, evaluate the properties and performance of erosion control products, and develop new, innovative products to minimize soil erosion. Using a multidisciplinary collaborative approach, Dr. Bhatia has worked closely with manufacturers, national and international agencies, and research centers in the development of sustainable solutions for soil erosion issues. Recently, Dr. Bhatia worked on a research project to assess stream restoration methods to reduce stream bank erosion in the Catskill Mountains. Dr. Bhatia has also performed research to evaluate the technical, political, and cultural aspects of the use of natural erosion control materials (coir and jute) in India and the United States. Dr. Bhatia has also established unique testing facilities at Syracuse University to test erosion control products. 
 Dr. Bhatia has also worked extensively on the development of sustainable materials and methods to dewater dredged sediment, a significant and urgent issue in the US and around the world. Dr. Bhatia is currently investigating the dewatering performance of twenty-five different dredged sediments from water bodies in the US using polymeric and natural flocculants and polymeric and natural fiber geotextiles. Bench-scale, pilot-scale, and large-scale tests will be conducted to evaluate the interaction between sediments, flocculants, and geotextiles. Unique testing facilities have been developed at Syracuse University to characterize the sediments and flocculants. A model will be developed incorporating the sediments, flocculants, geotextiles, and filter-cake characteristics to predict geotextile performance. The systematic study will explore the use of environmentally-friendly flocculants and geotextiles in dewatering and containing dredged sediments and also provide a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of chemically-conditioned sediment dewatering using geotextile tubes. The wealth of data that will be generated will allow for the thorough evaluation of existing test methods, the development of new test standards (in consultation with an industrial advisory board), and the creation of a model to verify results. Dr. Bhatia is also working extensively with industry and international researchers on the development of geotextile tubes for dewatering fly ash. 
 Dr. Bhatia has also been extensively involved in engineering education. She is co-director of the Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) initiative at Syracuse University. She is a Co PI of the National Science Foundation funded project SUADVANCE.

  My lab’s research focuses on constructing benchtop models of human tissues. We’re really interested in understanding the “rules of life” for how tissues form, so we can use that knowledge to improve the biomimicry of our engineered tissue models to understand the biology of development and disease. 
 How we do it: We do this by first mining existing datasets and using advanced imaging tools to further our understanding of homeostatic or pathological characteristics of tissue-specific microenvironments. We then take that knowledge, decide what parameter(s) we want to investigate, and engineer inquiry-specific microenvironments using synthetic hydrogels. Some projects focus on how altered initial conditions (e.g., matrix stiffness or viscoelasticity, integrin binding, extracellular matrix composition, and cell composition) impact morphogenesis. Other projects focus on the role of spatiotemporal dynamics of the extracellular microenvironment in shaping growing tissues. For this work, we use light-tunable materials to alter the properties of our synthetic microenvironments, in order to guide morphogenesis.

 Current Research: 
 Our group is focused on the design and application of catalytic materials for improving sustainability in the production of transportation fuels and chemical products. In our research, we leverage heterogeneous catalysis to facilitate the conversion of renewable feedstocks to drop-in replacements for traditional, petroleum-derived fuels. We approach this task mindful of the guiding principles of environmental stewardship and thus promote total biomass utilization, energy efficiency and conservation, and waste minimization as we strive to advance the state of the art in renewable energy.

 The Monroe Biomaterials Lab utilizes fundamental advances in polymer chemistry to provide biomaterials that could improve healing outcomes. Our research spans polymer synthesis, 3D scaffold fabrication, materials characterization, cell/material interactions, bacteria/material interactions, and in vivo characterization of biomaterials. Our research focuses on shape memory polymers (SMPs). These ‘smart’ materials can be deformed and stored in a temporary shape. Upon application of a stimulus (e.g. heating to body temperature, exposure to water), the materials rapidly return to their original shape. Specific applications of SMPs that we study include hemorrhage and infection control in traumatic wounds, infection surveillance and prevention in chronic wounds, and cell and antimicrobial delivery to Crohn’s fistulas.

 Current research: 
 Dr. Carter’s research in applied computational hydroclimatology attempts to fuse tools from modern data science with risk assessment in water resources engineering to mitigate social, environmental, and economic impacts of hydroclimatic extremes. Our success in utilizing our water resources infrastructure to reduce damages associated with the variable hydroclimate depends on our ability to diagnose and predict this hydroclimate variability at timescales which are relevant for adaptive management. This task is hampered by spatial and temporal sparsity of observations of hydrologic and hydroclimatic flux, complex patterns of space/time covariability in observations, and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio in hydroclimatic systems at the local scale. My research seeks to combat these obstacles by 1) integrating new sources of observational data, mostly from space-based assets, into diagnostic/predictive frameworks of hydrologic/hydroclimatic flux; 2) grounding data-driven analysis in a physical understanding of the hydrologic system through feature engineering and model diagnostics; 3) developing and utilizing data science algorithms which are appropriate for multivariate space/time systems, and 4) quantifying bias, error, and uncertainty in space/time models. Applications include automatic flood detection from multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery for disaster response (NASA/USGS/NGA), developing custom hydrometeorological forecasts for adaptive reservoir management, detecting drivers of hydroclimatic variability of the Great Lakes, and quantification of evapotranspiration and groundwater flux from space (NASA/USDA).

 Current Research: 
 My research investigates hydrologic change related to anthropogenic ecologic and climatic drivers. The primary lenses through which I view change are alteration of flow paths, water balance or infiltration capacity. To address these concerns, I have engaged in research projects targeted to guide land management in a wide range of geomorphologic and climatic settings. 
 Deforestation and rangeland succession: Wildland hydrology is governed primarily by subsurface flowpaths and plant water relations. Changes in land cover or climate often alter either of these controls in a manner that drives a complex response. My research focuses on the evolution of system properties for a given land cover and the consequences of abrupt alteration. 
 Climate change: Climate change is an important driver for terrestrial hydrology, yet most contemporary climate models operate at length and time scales much greater than those governing hydrologic processes. My students reconcile this problem by developing empirical relationships from long term data sets to predict the likely effects of continued climate change on regional hydrology. 
 Urban storm water: Approximately seven hundred cities in the USA require new infrastructure to replace the outdated combined sanitary sewer and storm drain systems. Many are interested in replacing or supplementing these systems with green infrastructure. I am currently developing capacity to understand the hydrologic performance, ecosystem interactions and functional limitations of the varied and widespread green infrastructure projects currently under construction in Syracuse and other cities in the Northeast USA. 
 Sustainability. The intersection of climate change, urbanization, culture and ecosystem function leads to complex and uncertain futures for urban sustainability. My group contributes data management expertise and geospatial analyses of cross cutting drivers of urban change to large research consortia interested in sustainability.

 Research Interests: 
 VLSI timing analysis and simulation Transistor/circuit level power leakage reduction Software debugging and verification Distributed data sharing and collaboration 
 Current Research: 
 A current work that a doctoral student and I are working on is to develop techniques to reduce leakage power of circuits during idle times. Two specific techniques are developed: (1) Leakage power behavior is examined for reordering serially connected transistor blocks. Based on that, we can then determine a primary input vector to a circuit to reduce its leakage power during idle mode. (2) Effect of body bias is studied for nano-scale transistor. A hybrid technique (mixing reverse body bias and forward body bias) is developed to reduce power leakage during idle mode. Another current work that a doctoral student and I are working on is to develop a tool for software debugging and verification. Traditional IDE allows setting of break points, but provides minimum supports in reasoning and bug locating. The goal of this research work is to allow programmers to query various properties of programs and help locating the causes of property violations. Another current work that a doctoral student and I are working on is to design a transistor level circuit simulator, which gives an accuracy near that of SPICE, and can handles much larger circuits in much less run time. Other research work involves distributed data sharing and collaboration, design of platform and protocol for emergency response systems, etc.

 Andria Costello Staniec was named Associate Provost for Academic Programs for Syracuse University in July of 2012, becoming the senior leader in Academic Affairs charged with ensuring the quality and effectiveness of academic programs and the academic success of SU students, including the collaborative development of policies and programs that promote instructional quality, advising effectiveness and student success. 
 Costello Staniec joined the faculty at Syracuse University in January, 1999. She received a Bachelor of Science in Applied Biology from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1992. Dr. Costello Staniec earned her Master’s and doctoral degrees in Environmental Engineering Science from the California Institute of Technology in 1995 and 1999, respectively. Her graduate study was performed in the broad area of applied environmental microbiology. As a graduate student, Dr. Costello Staniec was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship. Dr. Costello Staniec is a member of the American Society for Engineering Education, the American Chemical Society, the American Society for Microbiology, the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors, and the Society of Women Engineers. 
 Costello Staniec teaches courses in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Her classes are in the areas of environmental microbiology and biotechnological applications in engineering. Costello Staniec conducts multidisciplinary research aimed at elucidating the complex relationships between microbial diversity and function. Her research is focused on the development and application of molecular and microbiological tools to investigate both natural and engineered systems. Costello Staniec’s research interests include issues related to bioremediation, global biogeochemical cycles, and changes in microbial communities in response to anthropogenic disturbance. 
 Research Interests: 
 Costello Staniec is currently investigating the diversity of the methane oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) in soils in the northeastern United States. Methanotrophs are a group of bacteria that grow on methane as their sole source of carbon and energy. They can be isolated from a wide variety of environments and are believed to be ubiquitous in nature. Increased attention has been focused on the ecological implications of methane oxidation and the role of methanotrophs in both the global methane budget and the bioremediation of halogenated solvents. Research in the Costello Staniec lab has led to the development of tools designed to assess the microbial diversity and function of methanotrophs in natural and engineered systems. Costello Staniec is currently investigating the role of methanotrophs in the global carbon cycle at study sites in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. 
 In addition to her work with methanotrophs, Costello Staniec is involved with work relating microbial diversity to function at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF). Her research at the HBEF addresses the factors controlling microbial diversity in a northern hardwood forest and the relationships between microbial diversity, community structure, and microbial function in the ecosystem. Recent work includes the study of the effects of an entire watershed manipulation (liming) on soil microbial populations as well as investigations into the effects of acidic deposition on belowground microorganisms.

 Current Research: 
 Davidson is currently studying the performance of green infrastructure for stormwater management in Syracuse, focusing on the Convention Center Green Roof. At 0.56 hectares, this is one of the largest green roofs in New York State and also one of the best-instrumented green roofs in the country. Data are collected on temperatures at various depths in the roof structure, flow of drainage water during rainstorms, water storage in the soil, and several weather parameters. Leaf area index and other plant characteristics are measured for the six species of sedum growing on the roof. The data are used to adapt and validate computer models of water flow, storage, and evaporation from the roof. In other research, Davidson is studying how public and private organizations in the U.S. and Latin America decide on strategies to protect their city from the extreme events of climate change. The events include coastal flooding, droughts, extreme heat, and pluvial flooding at inland locations. The preferences for different strategies are examined through surveys.

 I have spent my academic career studying Introductory Computer Science Education, and my PhD thesis covered how to understand and define coding struggle in CS2 programming courses. I have also previously taught CS1 and CS2 courses. Part of my teaching experience showed me how historically underrepresented populations are affected by a lack of Computer Science experience when taking introductory courses, and my goal is to create an environment where every student can be successful.

 My research originally focused on translational polymeric biomaterials for orthopedics and nerve regeneration applications.  We worked on the design, synthesis, characterization,  in vitro  and  in vivo  evaluation of acrylic bone cements, nanoparticle drug delivery systems to treat spinal cord injury, and micropatterned and mechanically-active hydrogels.  We also developed new techniques for studying spinal cord injury  in vivo  and  in vitro .  Since 2012, my research program has gradually transitioned to a focus on engineering education, faculty development, and student success.  I have studied the impact of faculty-student interactions and peer interactions on student persistence towards a bachelor’s degree in Engineering and Computer Science.  Specifically, I investigate the link between faculty development in innovative pedagogy and advising practices, with implementation in Engineering and Computer Science courses and academic advising, and subsequent effects on student attitudes towards persistence and retention rates. I have also developed several cohort-based scholarship programs to support student success.

 Jha’s research focuses on developing quantum hardware using two-dimensional materials and heterostructures, III-V semiconductors, nanostructures, soft-materials, metamaterials, and hybrid combination of these materials. His research seeks to understand fundamental characteristics of these systems through combined experimental, theoretical, and computational studies and use those findings to gain control and induce novel optical, electrical, thermal, and mechanical responses in them. These responses, in turn, are leveraged to develop transformative devices and technologies for quantum information science, quantum sensing and metrology, nanophotonics, optoelectronics, and space exploration applications. Thus, his interdisciplinary research crosses the conventional scientific boundaries to merge applied physics with electrical engineering, materials science, and mechanical engineering.

 Advancements towards women’s health and children’s health are limited by our failure to understand the unique and complex biology of these populations. Pregnancy, at their intersection, is no less mysterious. Many adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth, stillbirth, and preeclampsia, have no clear root cause nor effective cure. Further, drug delivery to mom and/or baby is limited by our poor characterization of biological barriers like vaginal mucus and fetal circulation and how these barriers are altered by inflammation and associated adverse outcomes. Nanotechnology can be leveraged to better understand the biochemical features of pregnancy in health and disease and to develop more effective, targeted therapeutics for pregnant people. My research group will focus on two distinct biological environments that are vulnerable to inflammation during pregnancy: the vaginal microbiome and the fetal brain. Our long-term goal is to develop novel nanotherapeutic platforms that can attenuate inflammation to broadly promote maternal, fetal, and neonatal health.

 Point defects in semiconductors  
 Inverse design for large-scale photonic optimization 
 
 Kuate Defo’s research is focused on the theory underpinning the design of efficient devices for classical and quantum sensing, communication, and computation. His research achieves these aims through the development of ab-initio approaches to predict solid-state material properties; the determination of fundamental limits and efficient topology-optimization procedures to enhance light-matter interactions in nanophotonic devices; and the discovery and characterization of materials. He is particularly interested in the charge-state stability of point defects in wide band gap semiconductors for quantum sensing applications and in the dynamical process by which equilibrium of the Fermi level occurs in semiconductors. His program for research in nanophotonics uses computational and theoretical techniques to explore nanostructuring as a means of engineering materials with desirable figures of merit including large photonic bandgaps or significant Purcell enhancement.

 Dr. Laurent’s research focuses on the role of turbulence and fluid dynamics on aerodynamic performance. She explores both biological and man-made vehicle flight. In her work studying golden eagles, she found a strong relationship between the motion of the bird and the small-scale turbulence experienced by the bird when soaring. These results indicate a need to fully incorporate an understanding of turbulence into our understanding of eagle movements, with implications for other natural and artificial fliers. In the Laurent Fluid Dynamics Lab, her research aims to find engineering solutions to challenges in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by exploring both biological flight and swimming.

 History of Computing 
 
 I am interested in investigating, via mathematical means, the resources used (e.g., time, memory, no. of queries etc.) and the strategies required for solving problems that arise within a computing (e.g., machine learning etc.) context. In my prior studies, I used methods from mathematical logic (e.g., compatibility theory), discrete mathematics (e.g., combinatorial and algorithmic methods for graphs) and automata (e.g., omega automata) in my investigation. I am also interested in incorporating and integrating my expertise in computer science education (e.g. curriculum design and development, undergraduate research etc.) and, in the interplay between the history of computing and education where I find them crucial in educating future computing professionals and scientists. Regarding undergraduate research, some solution strategies formulated in my work are of interest to our students for studying concrete games, questionnaire design and in data analytic applications.

 Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) allows the recapitulation of human disease models in vitro, which can be used to both study disease mechanisms and ultimately design and screen personalized therapeutics prior to large animal or clinical trials. My research focuses on developing multi-scale cardiac models through the combination of stem cell biology, micro/nanotechnology and cardiovascular research. These in vitro models help us not only understand a variety of fundamental questions on cardiac physiology and development, but also improve the diagnosis and treatment for human heart diseases.

 Current Research: 
 Emerging Tools in Structural Engineering 
 The project Emerging Tools in Structure and Design, will focus on new and emerging design and construction methodologies that are making possible a new generation of structural form and form making. Generation and optimization software; rationalization and analysis tools; and fabrication methods, have all advanced considerably in recent years and are having huge influence on the cutting edge of collaborative practice between architecture and engineering. These tools facilitate ever more radical form making in ever more rational ways and make possible formal expressions and structural efficiencies and elegance that would have been prohibitively complex a mere handful of years ago. Although these tools are highly technical in nature, it can be argued that their development has been driven by speculative architectural design work, and that they are responding to the considerable and significant change in representation tools and construction capability in recent years. 
 The project will initiate a critical comparative analysis of these emerging tools. I want to trace the origin of the tools, the development, use in the design process, and ultimately the influence on contemporary design and design processes. Do these tools facilitate, or I dare say require, deeper and more rigorous collaboration between disciplinary specific technical experts and architects? How are these tools allowing for rapid testing of speculative designs? Do the tools make possible financial or material savings? In what ways do they impact the nature of the engineer/architect relationship? Does “authorship” enter into the equation? There is much to explore and

 Energy and water are two of the most important necessities to maintain global security, prosperity and equity in human civilization. The global energy use is estimated to increase by ~60% while nearly 4 billion people are expected to live under severe water stress by 2050. Drinking water production from seawater is a highly energy intensive process and is inherently coupled with increased energy consumption. Thus, energy efficiency plays an ever more important and critical role in limiting energy demand growth. My research primarily focuses on two fundamental aspects of science and engineering which manifests into a wide variety of applications: 1) thermal management and energy conversion, and 2) water desalination. My research group at Syracuse University is highly multidisciplinary which conducts experiments, nano/micro scale fabrication, and performs molecular and continuum numerical simulations, in the areas of thermal management, heat transfer, energy conversion, transport phenomena, desalination, and optics.

 My research is focused in using multi-paradigm programming to solve accuracy issues on User Interactive System, especially in Virtual and Augmented Reality.  This research uses dependency relationships between loosely coupled components. We use techniques of Functional Reactive Programming and Change Propagation to identify how a change may cause additional modification in other several components and force the systems to wrap all these modification in a single update cycle. This research resulted in a design pattern that was applied into User Interfaces, Virtual Reality and it can be applied on many other research fields.

 Routing protocols 
 Medium access control protocols 
 Wireless ad hoc networks 
 Unmanned aerial vehicles’ networks 
 LEO satellite networks 
 My research has focused on wireless ad hoc networks, especially the mobile/flying ones. I specialize in the design of routing protocols (Network layer) and medium access control (MAC) protocols (Link layer) for such networks, with the goal of increasing the packet delivery ratio and reducing the end-to-end packet delay/latency while keeping a low overhead. I am interested in integrating artificial intelligence (deep learning, reinforcement learning) in the design. Some applications networks are networks of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV/drones) and networks of LEO satellites.

 Areas of Expertise:  
 Programming Languages Static Analysis Formal Methods Foundations of Computer Security and Privacy 
 My research lies at the intersection of the theory and application of program analyses. Program analyses are tools that examine programs and determine (prove) facts about them. For example, a program analysis might prove that a program can never crash due to a type error. In general, however, program analyses can be arbitrarily complex and infer subtle program invariants relating to myriad applications (such as computer security). 
 Because program analyses must always approximate program behavior (otherwise they could solve the halting problem), there is an inherent tradeoff between analysis precision and analysis performance. Currently, program analyses are often applied only in limited contexts, as gaining acceptable performance requires too many compromises in terms of analysis precision. My current work focuses on three concurrent threads: tackling fundamental issues relating to scaling static analysis (specifically, scaling analyses to run on supercomputers rather than a single machine as all current analyses do); engineering those analyses (to allow analysis reuse); and applying those analyses to computer security (e.g., to check properties such as information flow and to support complex reverse engineering tasks).

 My research group focuses on studying blood-brain barrier using theoretical and computational techniques. The goal is to enable the transport of drug molecules across the blood-brain barrier, which has been the biggest impediment for finding a cure for brain related ailments such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. This project was funded through the NSF-CAREER award. 
 Additionally, we our group focuses on computational multiscale modeling of nanomaterials, including nanomedicine, drug delivery nanocarriers, and nano-bio interactions. The goal of this research is to design efficient nanosized drug delivery carriers to target cancer tumor cells that hold the key to a new era of cancer treatment. To achieve our research goals we are developing quantitative approaches for characterizing interaction of nanoscale entities with living matter (serum, cell-membranes, cells). Our computational approaches are directed to analyze these complex nano-bio interactions in an effort to design safe and smart drug delivery nanocarriers.

 Current Research: 
 My research primarily focuses on the development and application of mathematical models and specialty logics that support reasoning about complex system behavior, such as concurrency and cyber security. My recent work (joint with Shiu-Kai Chin) has centered on a modal logic for reasoning about access control, security, and trust. This logic can be applied at all levels of abstraction, from organizational policies to network protocols to operating-system requirements to hardware. 
 I am also interested in the technology transfer of these ideas (specifically, through undergraduate and graduate education): how does one best enable budding engineers and computer scientists to deploy these methods to develop assured systems?

 My primary research interest is understanding the mechanics of soft and squishy materials such as elastomers, hydrogels, and polymer melts. At a low energetic cost these materials can bend, fold, crease, pop or snap, exhibiting a variety of large (sometimes singular) and fast deformations. Their response emerge from an intricate coupling between geometry and material (surface and bulk) properties. Combining experimental, theoretical and numerical tools I study how soft materials behave when they are adhered to other substrates, wetted by liquid drops, or exposed to a flow. Leveraging this fundamental knowledge, my research lab aims to advance the development of flexible and wearable electronics, sensors and actuators for smart materials and functional surfaces.

 My research is gravitational wave (GW) detection and the emerging field of gravitational wave astronomy, specifically, maximizing the sensitivity of GW detectors so that we may “see” farther out into the universe.  The LIGO detector is a 4-km long interferometer with a differential arm length resolution < 10 -19  m, or 10 -4  of a proton diameter.  My primary work has been the development of LIGO’s “test mass” mirrors, whose motion indicates the passing GW.  These are the world’s most precise mirrors with the lowest optical and mechanical noise.   I led the research effort to develop the lowest noise glass that is used for the mirror substrates and suspensions.  I was a leader on the team that identified the significant noise contribution from mirror coating thermal noise and that developed the current mirror coatings. At present we have developed crystalline semiconductor mirror coatings, which promise a further 10x reduction in coating thermal noise.

 Areas of Expertise:  
 -Quantum information 
 -Decoherence 
 -Thermalization 
 -Emergent spacetime and quantum gravity 
 My research is aimed at elucidating how, and in what circumstances, thermalization, gravitational dynamics, and classical observables can be derived from the more fundamental underlying features of a quantum theory. My research is motivated by cosmology and quantum gravity, but primarily uses tools from quantum information. One of my research programs focuses on understanding the entanglement structure of quantum states. A second research program is concerned with the physics seen by observers with only limited access to, or an imperfect ability to make measurements on, the quantum state.

 Research interests: 
 Development of advanced computational modeling methods for designing new materials of advanced material functions. Bottom-up modeling of the multi-scale structure-mechanics relationship of nano- and bio-materials. Fundamental understanding of the material behaviors of biological and synthetic polymeric materials from the most molecular scale to macroscopic length scale. Learn from nature and discover bio-inspired ideas to create and design materials with innovative material functions. Prototyping, optimization and characterization of synthetic composite materials with multiple advanced material functions, for efficient usage of engineering materials. 
 Current Research: 
 My research focuses on developing advanced computational modeling methods, using them to study fundamental mechanical properties of biological materials and applying the knowledge to design new materials of advanced mechanical functions. I have a broad background in mechanics and structure of materials, with specific training and expertise in the multi-scale structure-mechanics relationship in biological materials. My research focuses on the structure and mechanics insight of general natural materials as many of them, such as mussel glue, insect wings and membranes, have fascinating mechanical and biological properties built up from simple basic molecular building blocks. I am thus strongly motivated to develop tools that enable us to learn from nature to make material innovations more efficient. I have developed a multi-scale high-throughput computational modeling method that enables me to study materials from the most fundamental molecular scale to macroscopic length scale. I have applied the tool to the investigations of several different biological materials and have revealed new mechanisms hidden in their complex structures. Some of the findings contribute to fundamental understandings of diseases that take place from the molecular scale; others contribute to designs and prototyping of synthetic composite materials with multiple advanced material functions. I have developed principles to help to optimize the material functions through structures, making it feasible to rationally design the mechanics and longevity of composite materials, leading to better performance with less energetic and environmental cost than conventional engineering materials for industrial applications.

 Current Research: 
 Historically, our understanding of bacterial physiology and development of antibiotics have been focused on active planktonic (free-swimming) cells. However, the vast majority of bacteria in nature and medical environments exist in surface-attached biofilms with varying levels of dormancy. With up to 1,000 times higher tolerance to antibiotics and disinfectants compared to their planktonic counterparts, deleterious biofilms cause serious problems such as chronic infections in humans as well as persistent fouling and equipment failure in industry. Biofilms are blamed for billions of dollars of losses and more than 45,000 deaths annually in the U.S. alone. Despite the well-recognized significance of biofilms, the mechanisms of biofilm formation and bacterial dormancy are still not fully understood with many fundamental questions unanswered. Controlling biofilms and dormant cells is also challenging. To address these challenges, we conduct both basic and translational research with specific interests in bacteria-material interactions, novel antifouling materials, new agents for controlling biofilms and dormant cells, synthetic biology for microbial control, and smart and safer medical devices.

 Research Interests: 
 Particulate and Multiphase Flows Fluid Mechanics Transport Processes in Biological Systems Algorithms Particle Interactions 
 Current Research: 
 Particulate and multiphase systems are encountered in many natural, biological, and industrial processes. Their behavior is governed by physics at multiple length scales – from molecular, to typical dimension characterizing the individual phase boundary, to macroscale on which the microstructure is changing. Understanding of these systems in general can be improved through use of numerical simulations of appropriate phenomena at various lengthscales, theories for multiscale modeling, and experiments. Our research focuses on development of efficient algorithms for numerical simulations and theory. We apply these to variety of multiphase problems, and compare the predictions with experiments carried out either by our collaborators or available in the literature.

 Fuel surrogates 
 Optimization 
 
 Andrea Shen earned her Ph.D. in the Engine Research Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison with research focused on the reduction of greenhouse gases by utilizing novel alternative fuels, both neat and blended with gasoline. To analyze the potential performance of those novel fuels in a computational model, she developed an optimization method for generating gasoline surrogate compositions that represent a real gasoline fuel, both physically and chemically, while taking important fuel properties and engine processes into account. Her work consisted of both this modeling and running gasoline- and surrogate-alternative fuel blends in a single cylinder spark-ignition direct-injection engine for validation purposes. She has a passion for teaching and mentorship as well, teaching Design of Machine Elements and mentoring a number of graduate and undergraduate students while at UW–Madison.

 My research interests lie in the field of mathematical optimization, especially in mixed-integer programming and combinatorial optimization. Much of my research has recently focused on network interdiction and fortification, along with bilevel mixed-integer optimization problems. I am particularly interested in interdiction problems that involve uncertain data, and/or in which there is an asymmetry of information among the players. My research has applications in areas including logistics, national security, healthcare, production, ecology, and sports. This research has recently appeared in journals such as  Operations Research ,  Mathematical Programming ,  IISE Transactions ,  Networks , and  INFORMS Journal on Computing , and has been supported by agencies including the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

 Nature’s marvelous ability to arrange proteins, sugars, and minerals from macro to nano scales has realized a wide range of ‘smart’ multifunctional structures optimized to satisfy specific environmental demands. Man-made manufacturing, however, is not able to match nature’s building capabilities. My central research focus is to develop new processing and printing technologies to create reliable models from single cell to tissue scale to capture key aspects of in vivo physiology and pathophysiology. Toward this goal, my group, with expertise in mechanical engineering, laser optics, biomaterials and cell biology, has developed a technology toolbox to process and print biocompatible thermoplastics, photosensitive hydrogels, and living cells and provide a manufacturing solution to advance research in bioprinting, microfluidics, organ-on-chip, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and single cell analysis.

 Modal Analysis  
 
 Dr. Sun’s research interests focus on understanding the underlying physics of fluid flows and designing physics-driven control strategies using high-fidelity numerical simulations, modal/non-modal analysis, and data science. The ability to control fluid flow behaviors can lead to quiet, economical, and efficient systems in fluid mechanics and aerodynamics. Because of high dimensionality, strong nonlinearity, and complexity in fluid physics, the design of effective control strategies can be challenging. Dr. Sun’s research focuses on uncovering the underlying physics of complex fluid flows using the cutting-edge techniques of modal analysis, such as modal decomposition, stability analysis, and resolvent analysis. The insights obtained from these analyses provide guidance for physics-driven control designs.

 I am interested in the intersection between cybersecurity and systems. My research mission is to bring systems security and efficiency to large-scale, emerging/evolving infrastructures and applications. 1) On the cyber-security front, I am interested in applying formal methods, protocol analysis, automated program analysis, and software testing techniques to discover vulnerabilities, detect attacks, and design secure systems. I am also interested in the security-oriented measurement of large-scale systems. 2) On the systems front, I am interested in workload analysis, benchmarking, design of optimization schemes and middleware in various host systems.  
 My recent research focuses on decentralized systems like public blockchains. I tackle the systems security/efficiency challenges at different blockchain layers, including application-level DeFi protocol, smart contracts, down to the systems-level consensus implementations, P2P networking, and web3.0 infrastructures. I am particularly interested in discovering and fixing design flaws in blockchains and DeFi applications using formal methods. My recent research on blockchain mempool security is well-recognized in the Ethereum/blockchain developer community. Besides, I am developing and disseminating blockchain educational materials.  
 In the past, I worked on confidential computing, trusted execution environments, applied privacy-preserving protocols, and cloud security.

 One aspect of my research focuses on using field and analytical approaches to study the fate and transport of mercury in aquatic ecosystems and develop technologies to mitigate mercury contamination. I am also working on creating low-cost sensors and passive sampling methodologies to help disadvantaged and underfunded communities, as well as developing countries, monitor water and air quality. 
 My previous engineering practice included designing urban water infrastructure, landfills, and assessing contaminated sites. I was part of a team addressing contaminant issues from the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Additionally, I am involved in international policymaking related to the sound management of chemicals and wastes through the UNEP Minamata Convention on Mercury.

 My research addresses fundamental questions in statistics-based signal processing, data/information fusion, sensor data processing, data analytics, machine learning and AI. My research has been generously funded for over four decades by Department of Defense, NSF, ARPA-E, EPA and many companies. Starting in the early 1980s, I have pioneered the area of data/information fusion and inference in sensor networks. While a lot of my work has been inspired by Department of Defense applications, I have also applied my research results to a wide variety of non-defense applications including IoT and health-related applications. For example, I have worked on imaging for breast cancer detection, and methods for more accurate Alzheimer disease detection. My current research includes detection and tracking, secure inference in distributed sensing systems, human-machine teaming for inference, and information fusion.

 Solvent Effects in Liquid-Phase Catalytic Processes 
 Biomass conversion to renewable energy and chemicals 
 Complex plastic waste recycling 
 
 The Walker lab studies the fundamental, mechanistic details underlying heterogeneously catalyzed reactions of biomass, waste plastics, and other sources of non-fossil-based organic carbon for renewable fuels and chemicals production. We leverage our group’s strengths in solvent effects, advanced spectroscopic methods, and materials synthesis to develop novel catalysts that enable atom-efficient conversion of renewable feedstocks into fungible products while resisting deactivation by poisons. 
 Our experimental approach combines catalyst synthesis, characterization, and reaction kinetics measurements. We collaborate extensively with theorists to combine our experimental measurements with quantum-chemical and/or molecular dynamics simulations, toward a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental bases by which catalysts transform raw materials into products. Current research topics include: 
 
 Alkali-metal-resistant, bi-functional metal and acid catalysts for hydropyrolysis of waste plastics and biomass 
 Grafting of polymer brushes onto support catalysts to direct selectivity and mitigate deactivation by poisons in liquid-phase processing of renewable oxygenates 
 Electrochemical production of renewable polymers precursors and other platform molecules

 The immune system is essential for many aspects of human health, such as, infections, autoimmune conditions, malignancies, and tissue regenerations. While the generations of immune responses are complicated processes that involves wide range of molecular and cellular interactions, many key aspects crucial for protective immune responses have been recently revealed, generating enormous opportunities for therapeutic interventions to greatly improve patient health. Various immune engineering strategies based on biomaterial platforms have shown promise in facilitating immunogenic materials trafficking, modulating cellular interactions, and more. My previous work has also demonstrated several approaches to engineer coordinated cellular and humoral immune responses for augmenting therapeutic responses. The research of our team at Syracuse is aimed at designing biomaterials strategies to delivering molecular stimuli in a temporal and spatial fashion for regulating immune functions. We are particularly interested in harnessing humoral immune responses for therapeutic purpose by regulating the cellular process involved.

 Areas of Expertise:  
 Material Emissions, Air Purification, Ventilation, and Indoor Air Quality Hygrothermal Performance of Building Materials and Enclosure Systems Building Energy and Environmental Systems Built Environmental Systems Measurements, Modeling, and Controls Intelligent Buildings Combined Heat, Air, Moisture and Pollutant Simulations (CHAMPS) Multi-disciplinary and Multi-scale Building Systems Design and Optimization Effects of indoor environmental quality on occupant exposure, productivity, and creativity 
 Professor Zhang’s research ranges multi-scale BES from nano/micro-scale in porous media to buildings and urban environment and involves engineering, architectural design, human health, and performance. Major ongoing research projects are: 
 Virtual Design Studio (VDS): development of a digital platform for an integrated and coordinated design of green buildings. The project involves close collaboration between engineers and architects to develop a designer-oriented software tool for performance-based building system design. BM-IDC: Building monitoring and intelligent diagnosis and control. Using a full-scale testbed, a “Virtual Building” based near real-time monitoring system is developed and deployed to collect essential data for fault detection and diagnosis, and improvement of building operation. CHAMPS: Development of combined heat, air moisture, and pollutant simulation software for building system design and control optimization. The CHAMPS simulation environment includes a whole building model, an enclosure model, an HVAC mode and a room model. It is supported by a collection of shared databases of weather, materials and assemblies, pollutants, sources, and sinks. Reduced-order models will be developed for near-real-time simulation in design and predictive control in the operation of buildings. ME-IAQ: Material emissions and indoor air quality. A model-based approach is taken to develop fundamental mass transfer models with essential model parameters determined from experiments. The research leads to better models for performance prediction and better test methods for evaluating both short and long-term emissions. ACT-IAQ: Air cleaning technologies and indoor air quality. A model-based approach is taken to develop better test methods, evaluate the performance of existing air cleaning technologies, and develop new ones for improving indoor air quality. BEST: Building enclosure system technologies. This research includes experimental measurements and modeling of the hygrothermal (thermal and moisture) storage and transport properties of various building materials, model prediction of their impact on enclosure assembly performance, and full-scale evaluation and validation at reduced and full-scale setting under both laboratory and field conditions. Effects of IEQ on human performance. Human subject study is performed using a total environmental quality research facility. The focus is on how the improved thermal and air quality via personal ventilation would impact the performance of creativity and productivity of building occupants.

 Dr. Zhang’s group’s research goal is to solve grand challenges where mechanics can play an important role and harness mechanics as an enabling tool to design smart materials and structures for future sustainability. Built on the core strength of mechanics, my group actively engages in highly interdisciplinary works, such as food design, smart materials, and biofilms. Examples of ongoing projects include: 
 
 Harnessing instabilities and active materials to design reconfigurable structures 
 Bio-inspired hybrid liquid and solid systems enabled by elasto-capillary and hygro-mechanical couplings 
 Mechanics guided shape-changing food 
 Mechanics of smart magnetic materials and structures 
 
 The fundamental mechanics understanding could also provide design principles of robotics and biomedical devices and establish virtual platforms for simulating and controlling them, especially for those with highly nonlinear deformation in complicated working environments (e.g., endovascular neurosurgery and smart catheters).

 My research focuses on causal inference theory and its applications to artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in understanding the principles of robust decision-making in the context of distribution shifts, including challenges of confounding bias, selection bias, and external validity, and using that understanding to develop more efficient, robust, and fair decision-making systems (i.e., agents). Here are a few questions I’ve been exploring:  
 
 How do we evaluate the causal effects of interventions from biased data? How do we draw robust counterfactual claims in the presence of distribution shifts?  
 
 
 How can robust off-policy learning methods be developed to evaluate candidate policies from biased data? How can we extrapolate informative knowledge from offline data to accelerate a future online learning process?  
 
 
 How can ethical concepts such as fairness and discrimination be incorporated into AI decision systems? How can we audit these systems to detect potential discriminatory behaviors?

 Embryonic development involves extensive lineage diversification, cell fate specification, tissue patterning and morphogenesis. Identification of the features that enable robust interpretation of developmental signaling using  in vivo  samples is a significant challenge. Recent studies of self-assembly processes of organ-like structures (organoids) from pluripotent stem cells  in vitro  have provided fresh insights into fundamental mechanisms underlying embryonic development. These stem cell-based  in vitro  models offer unparalleled opportunities for experimental control of key parameters, quantitative measurements, and mathematical modeling. 
 My lab sought to leverage sophisticated engineering approaches to achieve controllable  in vitro  platforms that could recapitulate sequential developmental events during human embryo development. These stem cell-based models will provide powerful experimental platforms to advance understanding of poorly understood embryonic disorders. With superior controllability and scalability, these platforms will also serve as effective tools for high-throughput drug and toxicity screening to facilitate diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of teratogenesis and birth defects.
